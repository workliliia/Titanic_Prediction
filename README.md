# Titanic_Prediction

Tackle the Titanic dataset. A great place to start is on Kaggle. Alternatively, you can download the data from https://homl.info/titanic.tgz and unzip this tarball like you did for the housing data in Chapter 2. This will give you two CSV files: _train.csv and test.csv which you can load using pandas.read_csv(). The goal is to train a classifier that can predict the Survived column based on the other columns._
